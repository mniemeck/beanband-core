    Welcome to the technical documentation of <strong>BeanBand</strong> core
    library. The core library, together with the sample input and output
    module, processes the user-generated song information to produce a
    human-hearable playback track.  It consists of three internal data models,
    five processing stages, one standard class ({@code Sequence}), and the
    orchestration module {@code Bandleader}. The stages are processed in the
    following order:
    <ol>
      <li> The <em>Parser</em> {@code org.beanband.cli.parser}</li>
      <li> The <em>Song Model</em> {@code org.beanband.model.song}</li>
      <li> One or more <em>Arranger</em> implementations from {@code org.beanband.arranger}</li>
      <li> The <em>Music Model</em> {@code org.beanband.model.music}</li>
      <li> One or more <em>Band</em> implementations from {@code org.beanband.band} </li>
      <li> The <em>MIDI Model</em> {@code org.beanband.model.midi}</li>
      <li>The <em>Engineer</em> {@code org.beanband.engineer}</li>
      <li>A <em>Sequence</em> {@code javax.sound.midi.Sequence}</li>
      <li>The <em>Renderer</em> {@code org.beanband.cli.renderer}</li>
    </ol>

    For more information please refer to the individual API documentation.
   
    <p><strong>Arrangers and Bands</strong></p>

    One point that needs to be emphasized is the separation of concerns between
    {@code Arranger} and {@code Band}. Since this is one of the most crucial architectural
    decisions, and the major key (no pun intended) to extensibility, always
    stick to the following guidelines when contributing to <strong>BeanBand</strong>.

    <ul>
      <li>{@code Band} and {@code Arranger} implementations should be developed
        completely independent of each other. Whenever you are in a situation
        where a Band is depending on a specific Arranger, consider re-designing
        your approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Arrangers</strong> are responsible for annotating the
        user-provided song information with <em>musicological information</em>.
        They make no assumptions on, or suggestions for, the actual performance
        of the music.</li>
      <li><strong>Bands</strong>, or more
        specifically <strong>Musicians</strong>, are responsible for
        transforming the song, including the annotations from the Arrangers,
        into actual music.  Every Musician is typically responsible for a
        single instrument, and has complete freedom on how to interpret the
        musical information.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Music Model</strong> is on purpose not designed to be
        dynamically extensible.  You should only extend the Music Model when
        you have a new type of musicological information to add.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Song Model</strong> should be kept a simple as possible at
        all costs. The basic design idea of <strong>BeanBand</strong> is to have
        the playback generation as clever as possible, so the user has to enter
        as little information as possible. For example, instead of making more
        style changes available in the Song Model, have the Band change it's
        style dynamically.</li>
      <li>Create a new Arranger, when you have a new type of musicological information
        to calculate (you might need an extension of the Music Model as well).</li>
      <li>Enhance an existing Arranger if you have a more clever way of calculating
        existing musicological information.</li>
      <li> You can also create a new Arranger with a lower priority to
        overwrite existing information. That might make sense if you want to
        build on the results from multiple higher-priority Arrangers.</li>
      <li>Create a new Band when you want to implement a new style of playing.
        Since the Band needs to be selected explicitly by the user, don't
        create new Bands for slight variations. Rather, enhance an existing
        Band to put variations into their performance automatically.</li>
      <li>Enhancing Bands to render better performances based on the same Song
        Model is the core of the <strong>BeanBand</strong> idea. Whenever in
        doubt, improving the music generation algorithms inside a Band is the
        way to go!</li>
      <li>As a general rule-of-thumb, put calculations that are relevant to
        multiple Bands and are independent of a specific style into Arrangers.
        Put specific calculations into Musicians.</li>
    </ul>
